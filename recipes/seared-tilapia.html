        </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 (4 ounce) tilapia fillets</li>
            <li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, or to taste (Optional)</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme, or to taste (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li> Rinse tilapia fillets in cold water and pat dry with paper towels. 
                Season both sides of each fillet with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place flour in a shallow dish. Gently press each fillet into the 
                flour to coat and shake off any excess.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Cook tilapia fillets in the hot oil, in batches if necessary, 
                until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes per side. </li>
            <li>Brush melted butter onto the tilapia fillets in the last minute before removing from the skillet. </li>
            <li>Drizzle fillets with lemon juice and garnish with parsley and thyme.</li>
        </ol>
