                <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice, or to taste (Optional)</li>
                <li>
                    1 teaspoon chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley, or to taste (Optional)
                </li>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Rinse tilapia fillets in cold water and pat dry with paper towels.
                    Season both sides of each fillet with salt and pepper.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place flour in a shallow dish. Gently press each fillet into the
                    flour to coat and shake off any excess.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook
                    tilapia fillets in the hot oil, in batches if necessary, until fish
                    flakes easily with a fork, about 4 minutes per side.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Brush melted butter onto the tilapia fillets in the last minute
                    before removing from the skillet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Drizzle fillets with lemon juice and garnish with parsley and thyme.
                </li>
